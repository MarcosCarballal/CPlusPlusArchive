A haiku is a short poetic form. Traditional
haiku contain 17 syllables in 3 lines of 5, 7,
and 5 syllables respectively.

Imagine what a programmer's life
would be with haiku error messages!

To have no errors
Would be life without meaning
No struggle, no joy

Yesterday it worked.
Today it is not working.
Programs are like that.
