6. The output of this setup of code is as follows
"Create a variable called wd1.
Set the word in wd1 to "Sonoma".
Create a variable called wd2
Write out the contents of wd1.
Sonoma                3       3       0       0
Write out the contents of wd2.
Sonoma                3       3       0       0
Set the word in wd2 to "State".
Write out the contents of wd2.
State                 5       6       0       0
Write out the word contained in wd1.
The word in wd1 is Sonoma
End the program."
7. The program called the constructor function once.
8. The program called the copy constructor function once.
9. The program called the destructor function twice after
   the end of the program.
10. The program called the SetWord function once.
11. The program called the GetWord function once.
12. The program called the WriteWord function three times.
13. The program called the constructor 11 times in total;
    10 times at the beginning and once at the end. The 
    program also calls the destructor function a total of
    13 times at the end of the program.
